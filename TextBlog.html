<p class="highlight">Virtual reality (VR) is an interactive computer-generated experience taking place within a simulated environment. It incorporates mainly auditory and visual feedback, but may also allow other types of sensory feedback like haptic. This immersive environment can be similar to the real world or it can be fantastical. Augmented reality systems may also be considered a form of VR that layers virtual information over a live camera feed into a headset or through a smartphone or tablet device giving the user the ability to view three-dimensional images.</p>
<p>Current VR technology most commonly uses virtual reality headsets or multi-projected environments, sometimes in combination with physical environments or props, to generate realistic images, sounds and other sensations that simulate a user's physical presence in a virtual or imaginary environment. A person using virtual reality equipment is able to "look around" the artificial world, move around in it, and interact with virtual features or items. The effect is commonly created by VR headsets consisting of a head-mounted display with a small screen in front of the eyes, but can also be created through specially designed rooms with multiple large screens.</p>
<p>VR cameras can be used to create 360-degree panorama videos. These can be viewed through smartphone VR glasses or gaming glasses. 360-degree camera shots can be mixed with virtual elements to merge reality and fiction through special effects.[citation needed]
Virtual reality cameras are available in various formats, with varying numbers of lenses installed in the camera. Cameras with one lens use the fisheye principle. For this technique, cameras film at an angle of 360°x235° so that no complete 360-degree image is produced. A black spot in the image on the VR glasses can be seen. Other camera models have 2 lenses, which are mounted close to each other. These VR cameras produce a fully spherical and gapless image. With this technique, the images are stitched together using special software. As of 2019, 360-degree cameras with two lenses had problems sewing the two images together. This means that the seam that is supposed to join the two images together is often still visible.</p>

<p class="highlight">VR is most commonly used in entertainment applications such as gaming and 3D cinema. Consumer virtual reality headsets were first released by video game companies in the early-mid 1990s. Beginning in the 2010s, next-generation commercial tethered headsets were released by Oculus (Rift), HTC (Vive) and Sony (PlayStation VR), setting off a new wave of application development.</p>
<p>3D cinema has been used for sporting events, pornography, fine art, music videos and short films. Since 2015, roller coasters and theme parks have incorporated virtual reality to match visual effects with haptic feedback .</p>
<p>In social sciences and psychology, virtual reality offers a cost-effective tool to study and replicate interactions in a controlled environment.[52] It can be used as a form of therapeutic intervention. For instance, there is the case of the virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET), a form of exposure therapy for treating anxiety disorders such as post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and phobias.
